## What We Improved

### Finding Candidates Just Got Easier (For Recruiters)

**The Problem:** When you searched for candidates, you only got about 10 results. Not enough options to find the right person.

**What's Different Now:**
- Copy and paste any job description into the search box
- The system reads it and pulls out the important skills automatically
- You'll see 50 to 200 candidates per search (way more options!)
- You can click to add or remove skills before you search
- If you come back later, your previous search is saved and ready to use again

**What This Means For You:**
Spend less time writing searches. Get more candidates to choose from. Find the right person faster.

### Adding New Clients is Less Frustrating (For Account Managers)

**The Problem:** You're filling out the "Add Client" form, you switch to another tab to look up a phone number or website, and when you come back - everything you typed is gone. Super annoying!

**What's Different Now:**
- Type information into the form
- Switch tabs, check your email, do whatever you need
- Come back and everything you typed is still there
- You can also add a second contact person now (like if the client has both a hiring manager and an HR director you work with)

**What This Means For You:**
No more retyping the same information three times. No more frustration.

### Get Answers When You're Stuck (For Recruiters)

**The Problem:** You see buttons and options but aren't sure what they do or how to use them.

**What's Different Now:**
- Click the "Help" button on the Talent Search page
- Read clear explanations of:
  - What the percentage match score means
  - How to use all the search options
  - What "Deep Search" vs "Basic Search" actually does
  - How to import multiple candidates at once
  - And much more

**What This Means For You:**
Get unstuck without calling support. Learn the system at your own pace.

## Small Improvements You'll Notice

**When Searching for Candidates:**
- You can now include as many skills as you want in a search (used to stop at 15)
- You'll see more relevant candidates in your results

**When Adding Clients:**
- The form is more compact and easier to read
- You must fill in: Company Industry, Website, and at least one contact person (name, email, phone)
- This keeps your client list complete and useful

## We Fixed Some Problems

**Fixed: The disappearing client form**
We already mentioned this above - your typed information now stays put when you switch browser tabs.

**Removed: A broken feature**
There was a button that said "Enrich Profile" that stopped working. We removed it so it won't confuse you anymore.
