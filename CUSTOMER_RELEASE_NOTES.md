## 🎉 New Features

### Smarter Talent Search
We've completely redesigned how the system finds candidates for your job openings:

- **AI-Powered Job Description Parser**: Just paste a job description, and the system automatically identifies:
  - Required skills
  - Nice-to-have skills
  - Tools and technologies
  - Certifications

- **Better Search Results**: You'll now see 50-200 candidate results per search instead of just 10, giving you a much larger talent pool to choose from.

- **Pick and Choose Skills**: You can now add or remove individual skills before searching, giving you complete control over your candidate search.

- **Faster Repeat Searches**: The system remembers your previous job description analysis, so you can instantly reload and modify searches without starting over.

### Improved Client Management
Managing client companies is now easier and more flexible:

- **Add Secondary Contacts**: You can now add a second contact person for each client (optional), making it easier to work with multiple stakeholders.

- **Never Lose Your Work**: When adding a new client, your entered information is automatically saved as you type. If you need to switch browser tabs to look up information, your data will be waiting for you when you come back.

- **Required Information**: To keep your client database complete, the system now requires you to fill in the company industry, website, and primary contact details.

### Comprehensive Help Guide
New detailed help documentation is now available:

- Explanations of how candidate matching works
- Tips for building effective search queries
- Guides for bulk operations
- Descriptions of all search modes and filters
- And much more!

Access the help guide anytime from the Talent Search page.

## 🔧 Improvements

### Talent Search

- Extended search depth to find more candidates

### Client Management

## 🔨 Bug Fixes

- **Fixed: Add Client popup closing unexpectedly** - The popup would disappear when switching browser tabs, causing you to lose entered information. This is now resolved.

- **Removed: Profile Enrichment feature** - We removed a LinkedIn profile enrichment feature that was no longer working due to the service provider shutting down. This prevents error messages you may have encountered.
