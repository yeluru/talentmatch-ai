TalentMatch AI — Roles & Permissions (Product-Friendly)

Purpose
This document explains who can do what in TalentMatch AI in plain language.
It covers platform-level administration (internal team) and customer-level administration (each organization).

Read this first (context)
- This is a multi-tenant SaaS product: many customer organizations share the same app, but must never see each other’s data.
- “Roles” exist to prevent accidental access and to make sure the right people can do the right actions.
- We separate internal administration (platform) from customer administration (organization) on purpose.

Key Concepts (non-technical)
- “Platform” = internal admin view across all customers.
- “Organization” = a customer/tenant (a company using the product).
- “Users” = candidates, recruiters, managers, and org admins.
- “Invite-only” = the user cannot sign up themselves; they must receive an invite link.
- “Public candidate” = a candidate who is not tied to any organization (they can exist independently).

Roles
1) Platform Admin (internal)
2) Org Admin (Customer “Org Super Admin”)
3) Account Manager (Customer manager)
4) Recruiter (Customer recruiter)
5) Candidate (Job seeker)

High-level rules
- Only Candidates can self-sign up in the app.
- Org Admin, Account Manager, and Recruiter are invite-only.
- Org Admins can manage only their own organization’s users and candidates.
- Platform Admin can see everything but should only “change” Org Admins; other data is read-only from the platform UI.

What each role can do

1) Platform Admin (internal)
Can do (write actions)
- Create a new customer organization.
- Invite an Org Admin for that organization.
- Revoke Org Admin access (remove the Org Admin role from a user).

Can see (read-only)
- All organizations and all users across the platform.
- High-level dashboards and lists (for support and monitoring).

Cannot do (from the platform UI)
- Suspend or delete users (handled directly via Supabase Studio / controlled ops).
- Modify customer hiring data (jobs, applications, candidates) via platform UI.

2) Org Admin (Customer “Org Super Admin”)
Scope: only their organization.

Can do (write actions within their org)
- Invite and remove Account Managers.
- Invite and remove Recruiters (recommended so org admin isn’t blocked if no account manager is available).
- View all users in their organization.
- View tenant audit logs (org-scoped) for troubleshooting and compliance.
- Manage candidates in their organization:
  - View candidates linked to their org
  - Add internal notes/statuses (product-defined)
  - Link/unlink candidates to their org (recommended)

Cannot do
- View other organizations’ users/candidates.
- Delete candidate accounts permanently (recommended to keep deletions platform-only).

3) Account Manager (Customer manager)
Scope: only their organization.

Can do
- Invite and remove Recruiters within their org.
- View recruiters and org-level hiring activity as allowed by product.

Cannot do
- Manage Org Admins.
- See or manage other organizations.

4) Recruiter (Customer recruiter)
Scope: only their organization.

Can do
- Run hiring workflows (jobs, applications, candidate review) within their org permissions.

Cannot do
- Manage roles/users.
- Access other organizations.

5) Candidate (Job seeker)
Scope: self.

Can do
- Sign up and manage their own profile/resume and applications.
- May be “public” (not tied to any org) or linked to an org if invited/associated.

Cannot do
- Manage other users.
- Access other candidates’ data.

Candidate “public vs org-linked” model
- Public candidate: not tied to any organization by default.
  - Only the candidate (and Platform Admin read-only) can see them.
- Org-linked candidate: tied to one organization.
  - Org Admin / Account Managers / Recruiters can see them according to the org’s access rules.

Invite chains (how users are created)
- Platform Admin → invites Org Admin (creates organization + sends invite link).
- Org Admin → invites Account Manager (sends invite link).
- Org Admin and/or Account Manager → invites Recruiter (sends invite link).
- Candidate → self-signup (email confirmation may be required).

Recommended safety boundaries (for PM alignment)
- Keep Platform Admin mostly read-only; only allow Org Admin lifecycle actions.
- Keep destructive actions (delete/suspend) out of the app UI; handle via controlled ops/Studio.
- Org Admin can manage users inside their org but cannot affect other tenants.
